  Hey there! I'm an aspiring evolutionary biologist and botanist. 
  
  My mission is to study and protect our natural heritage in the field, lab, and command line. 
  I want to push a frontier in our science by learning and applying modern genomic tools.
  
  Right now, I'm an ORISE Fellow at the Sustainable Perennial Crops Lab at the USDA's Agricultural Research Service, 
  where I generate resources and analyses like genome assemblies and SNP panels for economically important tropical plants and their pathogens.
  
  In the Fall of 2023, I'll be matriculating at Columbia University as a PhD student under the mentorship of Professor Deren Eaton.

  2023.04.12: After receiving offers from graduate schools, I've decided to attend Columbia University in the fall! 
  Many thanks to all my friends and family, my recommenders, and the advisors that welcomed me to their labs for visits.
