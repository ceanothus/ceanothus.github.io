    Thread blight disease (TBD) is a serious emerging threat to global cacao production, causing leaf blight symptoms and necrosis in the canopy of infected trees. 
    Though previously thought to be caused primarily by the fungus *Marasmiellus scandens*, recent work has revealed that a variety of pathogenic Marasmiaceae are responsible for TBD, with Marasmius tenuissimus identified as the dominant causal agent of TBD in Ghanaian cacao plantations. 
    *M. tenuissimus* has also been reported in remote organic cacao plantations in the Amazonas Department of Peru, infecting 90-100% of the trees surveyed. 
    Here we have assembled and annotated the nuclear genome of *M. tenuissimus* isolate GH-37. 
    This resource is a first attempt at a high-quality draft genome utilizing both second- and third-generation sequencing for *M. tenuissimus* and extends the current understanding of the evolution, ecology, and virulence of this pathogen"
